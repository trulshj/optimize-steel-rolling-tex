\section{Conclusion}

In this project we delved into the the problem of optimal cooling of a steel slab. The governing state equation was the homogeneous heat equation, with heat conduction through only parts of the boundary. The problem we considered was reaching a desired end time temperature, by applying coolant at the boundary. 

We used the formal Lagrange method for finding the adjoint equation and the gradient of reduced cost functional. We also showed existence of a solution to the state equation,  existence and uniqueness for the adjoint equations, and existence of a minimiser of the optimisation problem.

To solve the problem numerically we applied the gradient descent method with Armijo line search, and used FEniCS for solving the PDEs. The results showed that the numerical method were able to converge to a minimum of the cost functional. 

As described in Section \ref{sec:test-cases}, we also tried implementing a second cost functional, which we expected to give a gradient that was not constant in the time variable. However, we were not able to get the desired results at this point, and we assume there is still some error in the code we were not able to find.
