\section{Introduction}
We consider the optimal control problem for the controlled cooling of steel. Our end goal is to obtain a desired temperature $\theta_d$. In order to model such a cooling process mathematically, we use linear heat equation as our state equation, given by
\begin{subequations}
   \label{eq:heat}
   \begin{align}
      \rho c_p \theta_t - \nabla \cdot (k \nabla \theta) &= 0 \quad &\text{in } \Omega \times (0,T),\label{eq:heat-in-omega} \\
      -k \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial \nu} &= u(t) (\theta - \theta_w) \quad &\text{on } \Gamma_1 \times (0,T), \label{eq:state-system-bd-1} \\
      -k \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial \nu} &= 0 \quad &\text{on } \Gamma_0 \times (0,T), \label{eq:state-system-bd-2} \\
      \theta(x, 0) &= \theta_0 &\text{in } \Omega. &
   \end{align}
\end{subequations}
Here, $u = u(t) \colon [0, T] \to \mathbb{R}$ is the scalar-valued, time dependent heat transfer coefficient which acts as our unknown control, $c_p$ is the heat capacity, $k$ is thermal conductivity and $\rho$ is the density. The Neumann boundary condition in \eqref{eq:state-system-bd-1} is based on Newton's law of cooling; $\theta_w$ is the temperature of the applied coolant at the boundary. The goal is to determine a optimal $u$ such that $\theta(x, T)$ is ``as close as possible'' to some desired temperature $\theta_d$, where $T$ denotes the final time of the process. In order to model this we introduce a quadratic tracking term into the cost functional. We also require the control $u$ to be \emph{admissible}, i.e. it it possible to apply the found control $u$ in some practical manner.

More formally, we wish to minimize a cost functional of the form
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cost-func}  % Abuse of notation?
   \min J(\theta, u) = \frac{1}{2} \int_\Omega (\theta(x, T) - \theta_d)^2 \mathop{dx} + \frac{\gamma}{2} \int_0^{T} u^2 \mathop{dt}
\end{equation}
subject to
\begin{equation}
      \theta \colon \Omega \times [0, T] \to \mathbb{R} \text{ solves \eqref{eq:heat}},
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
   u \in U_{\mathrm{ad}}.
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
We have defined $Q \coloneqq \Omega \times (0, T)$. Here $\gamma \geq 0$ is a penalizing parameter called Tikhonov regularization parameter, and the last term in $J(\theta, u)$ is a regularizing term which penalize high costs of the control.

In this report we shall first develop first-order optimality conditions for \eqref{eq:heat}, then in Section 3 we prove existence of an optimal control, then we consider two gradient-based optimisation methods; The projected Gradient and Newton's method with primal-dual active set strategy, then we consider their performance on a test problem and on a more realistic situation used in the industry, finally we discuss some further improvements to the model used here.
